# TTA-C-PlusPlus-UnrealEngine-Projects
 
# Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio of C++ projects completed as part of the TTA-C-PlusPlus-UnrealEngine course. This collection showcases my experience and skills as a C++ developer, covering a range of topics and challenges. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in different aspects of C++ programming, from basic concepts to more advanced techniques. Let's dive into each project and explore the unique features and accomplishments of each one.

# BasicChallenges
The BasicChallenges project was the starting point of my journey in C++ development. It provided a solid foundation by introducing fundamental concepts such as input/output handling, variable declarations, and basic programming constructs. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to display "Hello World" in the console, utilize various data types and keywords, and create a basic program that accepts user input. The BasicChallenges project highlighted my understanding of essential C++ syntax and set the stage for further exploration and growth.

# MathOperatorsChallenge
The MathOperatorsChallenge project allowed me to delve into the world of mathematical operations in C++. I showcased my skills by utilizing a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operators. By accurately implementing these operators and displaying their results, I demonstrated my ability to manipulate numerical data and perform calculations. This project expanded my understanding of C++ operators and their significance in mathematical computations.

# HarderChallenges
The HarderChallenges project pushed my C++ skills further by presenting more complex coding tasks. It encompassed a wide array of topics, including multi-line code comments, utilizing various functions like max(), sqrt(), and round(), and implementing control structures such as if statements, loops, and switch statements. I successfully completed these challenges by combining my knowledge of C++ syntax and problem-solving abilities. The HarderChallenges project showcased my ability to tackle advanced programming concepts and apply them effectively.

# difficultchallenges
The difficultchallenges project allowed me to explore C++ in-depth, covering advanced topics and techniques. I showcased my expertise by utilizing memory management concepts like pointers and references, implementing functions with multiple parameters and return values, and understanding object-oriented programming principles such as class creation, inheritance, and polymorphism. By completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to handle complex programming scenarios and apply advanced C++ features.

# PPpdogs Project
The PPpdogs project focused on object-oriented programming in C++. I designed a Dog class with specific properties and behaviors, including breed, color, height, weight, and actions like shaking, sitting, and laying down. By creating objects and instantiating the Dog class with the provided specifications, I showcased my ability to encapsulate data and behaviors within classes, emphasizing my proficiency in OOP concepts. The PPpdogs project highlighted my ability to create reusable and organized code structures using classes and objects.

# ShapeSuperClass Project
The ShapeSuperClass project delved into the principles of inheritance and polymorphism in C++. I successfully implemented a superclass called Shape and derived subclasses, including Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle. Each shape subclass inherited the color property from the Shape superclass and implemented the getArea() method specific to its shape. This project demonstrated my understanding of class hierarchies, inheritance, and the concept of polymorphism, showcasing my ability to design and implement complex class structures.

# Calculatortutorial Project
The Calculatortutorial project involved creating a functional calculator using C++. It allowed me to showcase my skills in input/output handling, arithmetic operations, error handling, and user interface design. By implementing the calculator's core functionalities, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, I demonstrated my ability to build a practical application with a user-friendly interface. The Calculatortutorial project emphasized my problem-solving skills, attention to detail
